## Car example

This example depicts a car with a limited fuel supply that has to reach a set location. Locations are represented as separate nodes linked by roads, which are also nodes. The car travels "blindly", meaning it doesn't move to a location closer to the destination, but it will choose one non-deterministically from those nearby.
The example has a model checker set up to see if the car can reach its destination or not.
